In this repository you will find the totality of the work I did during my data science internship at Stats perform. I was give several large CSV files
containing the SportVU optical tracking system's quality. The goal of my internship was to analyse this data in order to create a predictive model to try a predict 
the SportVu's quality. I proceeded in the following order:

1. Cleaning the data from the CSV files using Pandas
2. Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas and Numpy
3. Created visuals with Scikit Learn to present to my team
4. Build and Train a Neural Network with Keras and Tensor flow
